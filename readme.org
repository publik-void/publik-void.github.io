* Presentations and posters for the PhD project "Individually tailored digital-motor outcomes in real life"

For the time being, this repository is mirrored on GitHub as
~publik-void.github.io~ to host the presentations and posters for public online
access.

~index.html~ contains a list of links to individual presentations or posters and
represents the "landing page" when accessing [[https://publik-void.github.io]].


* Exporting to PDF

#+begin_src sh
npm run export
#+end_src

Or:

#+begin_src sh
mkdir -p pdf

# substitute `slides` to match the file to be exported
chromium \
  --headless=new \
  --print-to-pdf=pdf/slides.pdf \
  --generate-pdf-document-outline \
  slides.html
#+end_src

* Development

#+begin_src sh
# Setup
npm install

# To run a development server
npm run server
#+end_src

For some of the presentations, some scripts may need to be bundled before they
display properly when opening them in a browser.

#+begin_src sh
# To bundle manually
npm bundle-dev

# To bundle from scratch and in production mode
npm bundle
#+end_src

A git hook that bundles and includes the scripts automatically in every commit
can be created by putting the following into ~.git/hooks/pre-commit~:
#+begin_src sh
#!/bin/sh

# Run the npm bundle command
npm run bundle

# Add the generated files from `dist/` to the commit
git add dist/*
#+end_src
